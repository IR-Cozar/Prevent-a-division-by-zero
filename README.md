This code presents a function to prevent division by zero in Fortran. The function provides a solution to a common programming problem. The algorithm involves obtaining the absolute value of the denominator in a division. Then, comparing it with a tolerance value (a value close to zero) and saving the larger one. Finally, evaluating the division with the larger absolute value, maintaining the sign of the original denominator
